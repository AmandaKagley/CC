## A way for students at SCC to communicate with each other.

This webite is designed for ONLY the students of Saint Charles Community College. The students will have the opportunity to create their account using their SCC email and password. Anyone who has not taken classes for 12 months or longer will lose access to the site and will have to create a new account if they pursue more classes at SCC. 

#### A team of students from St. Charles Community College created this site to make life a little easier going through difficult times while getting through our educational experience. Here is how you can reach us with any questions, concerns, and reccomendations: 
 * Amanda Kagley - Ak205788@my.stchas.edu
 * Mitchell Jones - Mj265496@my.stchas.edu
 * Alexander Brinkley - Ab278275@my.stchas.edu
 * Manoela Toro - Mt258531@my.stchas.edu
